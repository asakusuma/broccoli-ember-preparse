# broccoli-ember-preparse
Broccoli plugin that applies some compile time performance optimizations to an ember build.

Essentially a broccoli plugin version of [define-rewriter](https://github.com/chadhietala/define-rewriter).

Credit to [Chad Hietala](https://github.com/chadhietala) and [Kris Selden](https://github.com/krisselden) for the idea and the proof of concept.
